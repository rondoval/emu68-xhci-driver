# emu68-xhci

**emu68-xhci** is an Amiga OS driver for a XHCI USB controller.
The driver is based on [Das U-Boot](https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot) XHCI driver.

This is currently a work in progress and is **NOT** working.
It's a Poseidon v4.5 driver. Current status is it's able to enumerate the USB 2.0 hub and (sometimes) a thumb drive on it. Bulk transfers are not working and control are unstable, so not usable at all.
